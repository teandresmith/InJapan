# InJapan

InJapan is a personal blog that is about real life experiences of a foreigner that lives in Japan. Its purpose is to provide raw, uncut information on Japanese culture and social issues.

This website is a complete revamp from my previous version that used an entirely different tech stack.

## New Tech Stack

JavaScript / Node.js / Express / MongoDB

Frontend is powered by vanilla JavaScript and custom CSS.

Makes use of Express.js, a node.js framework, and also implements Handlebars as a template engine.

Implements MongoDB as a database, and Mongoose to work alongside mongoDB in Javascript.


## Old Tech Stack

Python-Flask / SQLAlchemy / PostgreSQL / Bootstrap
