# InJapan

InJapan is a personal blog that is about real life experiences of a foreigner that lives in Japan. Its purpose is to provide raw, uncut information on Japanese culture and social issues.

This website is a complete revamp from my previous version that used an entirely different tech stack.

New Tech Stack -> JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.

Old Tech Stack -> Python-Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap
